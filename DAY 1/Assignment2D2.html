        /*There is a basic difference between var let and constant on the basic of the 
        updation and redeclaration 
        1.Var:Var can be redeclared or updated within its scope
        that is n the scope that it has been designed 
        2. let:let variable once declared can not be declared again but it can be updated
        this is usefull when we have more than one developer and we dont want the 
        variable to be redeclare 
        3.Const: Constants as the name suggest cannot be updated or redeclared 
        examples given below*/
